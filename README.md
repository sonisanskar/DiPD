Riots and protests, if gone out of control, can cause havoc in a country. We have seen examples of this, suchas the BLM movement, climate strikes, etc., which caused worldwide disruption. Our motive behind creatingthis dataset was to use it to develop machine learning systems that can give its users insight into the trendingevents going on and alert them about the events that could lead to disruption in the nation. If any event startsgoing out of control, it can be handled and mitigated by monitoring these events before the matter escalates.This dataset collects tweets of past or ongoing events known to have caused disruption and labels these tweetsas 1.
